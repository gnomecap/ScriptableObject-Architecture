[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.gnomecap.scriptableobject-architecture?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.gnomecap.scriptableobject-architecture/)

Makes using Scriptable Objects as a fundamental part of your architecture in Unity super easy. Forked from [Daniel Everland's ScriptableObject-Architecture](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture/)

Based on [Ryan Hipple's 2017 Unite talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)

Reading Daniel's [Quick Start Page](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture/wiki/Quick-Start) is recommended!

> [!NOTE] 
> This is GnomeCap's fork of Daniel Everland's ScriptableObject-Architecture package. Suited to our needs. Use with a grain of salt ðŸ˜Ž

## Our Changes:
- Added simple editor to see what GameObject Components are referencing scriptable events, collections, and variables
- Added a Unity Action to allow a script with a reference to a GameEventListener to subscribe to EventRaised without having to use the Inspector GUI.
- Formatted as a package for potential OpenUPM Integration
- Reorganized CreateAssetMenu items to go under "ScriptableObjectArchitecture" tab more neatly.
- Implemented [pull request #170](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture/pull/170)
- Implemented [pull reuest #157](https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture/pull/157)
